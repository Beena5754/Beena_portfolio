        <p>
            Hi! I am <b>Beena Antony</b>, I am a hardworking and detail-oriented B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a desire to learn about technology and innovation.I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, particularly in embedded systems, robotics, and programming.Apart from my core course, I have also developed interest in newer technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing. I have already taken foundation courses in Python, AI, Machine Learning, and web development basics, and would be eager to apply these skills on real-world projects. I enjoy solving problems, team work, and keeping in touch with the latest technologyÂ trend.

            <h3>Audio Signal processing Agentic AI</h3>
            <p>An Audio Signal Processing Agent assists in designing or debugging circuits like preamps, filters, and amplifiers. It can answer queries such as "Why is my audio amplifier producing noise?" or "How do I reduce distortion in my op-amp circuit?". The agent provides filter design suggestions, grounding tips, and noise elimination techniques.
                I Used IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite AI model and deployed it in IBM Cloud Lite Environment</p>
